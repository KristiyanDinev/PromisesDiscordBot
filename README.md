# PromisesDiscordBot
A simple bot for messaging discord users with a promise of God and maybe some study.
The configuration and the database should be in the same path as the JAR.

## Playlists
`/playlists` folder will contain the playlists. Each playlist is inside a folder and that folder's name is the playlist's name, which should be inside that `/playlists` folder.

## Database
`users.sqlite` will contain the subscribed members and their timezones.

## Promises
`/promises` will contain the promises in JSON format. Each promise has it's own single file.

## Bot Token
Put `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` as environment variable.
